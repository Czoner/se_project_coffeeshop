# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

Maybe Im thinking about how to make a video play when i hover over it and have it play automatically. I think that would cool and also to understand everything much more clearly.
